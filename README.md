This was a project that I took on to try and become more efficient in my data quality checks for district data that we receive from districts. 

I first taught myself the fundamentals of Python and then replicated all of our data checks that we completed in excel using Python. This allowed me to complete 
all of my data checks in a much more efficient manner than using pivot tables and vlookups/xlookups in excel.
